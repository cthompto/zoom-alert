# Zoom Alert

A basic alert system work around form students stuck in my Zoom waiting room

## Concept

- Create a simple web interface with a student screen (index.html) and a teacher screen (listen.html) connected by socket.io.

- When a student presses the button on the student screen, it triggers an animation on the teacher screen.

## Use

I will keep the teacher screen open in a browser window to give me a more substantial visual notification of students stuck in the waiting room.

## Possible Other Features

Add a notification trigger the browser itself.

## To do

- Attach Animation to listener page for visibility.
